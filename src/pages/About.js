      <h3>The Golden Age of Cocktails</h3>
There was a time, basically up through the 1970s, when a good many homes had their own mini bars, and cocktails were regularly served each evening
Cocktails were a part of life and a part of the culture. 
However, the home bar nearly became extinct as media focus shed a brighter light on the dangers of alcohol abuse. 
Make no mistake, there's a big difference between alcohol abuse and responsible drinking. 
It is possible to enjoy a cocktail or two without going overboard, but everyone must realize their limit and stick to it.
